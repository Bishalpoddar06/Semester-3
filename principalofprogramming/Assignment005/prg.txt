Create overloaded functions to manipulate strings in different ways:
i. concatenation,
ii. repetition,
iii. substring extraction,
iv. case conversion
2. Create overloaded functions to perform mathematical operations such as add, subtract, multiply, divide, that work with integers, floats.
3. Create overloaded functions to process arrays of different types such as int, double, char with different operations
          i. sort,
          ii. reverse,
          iii. max/min.

4. Create overloaded functions to calculate area and perimeter for different geometric shapes such as circle, rectangle,
 triangle using different parameter combinations.
